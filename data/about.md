## About us

**Hello, and welcome to Notary Shop UK.**

We provide a wide range of notarial services to members of the public and to
business entities. Our registered notary is Dermot Winters. 

Mr Winters is a vastly experienced lawyer and a Notary Public, appointed by the Court of Faculties of the
Archbishop of Canterbury and regulated by the Master of Faculties. 

Our firm is based in Darlington, Co. Durham.  We provide notarial services throughout the Northeast of England.

We welcome out-of-hours and/or off-site appointments including weekends
(strictly subject to availability).

We aim to respond to client needs within 24 hours of instruction, but if we are
unavailable for any reason, we will be able to recommend a highly qualified
suitable alternative within the region.

### What is a Notary Public?

A Notary Public is a highly-qualified and highly-regulated legal professional
who specialises in authenticating, preparing, reviewing, and advising various
types of documentation which invariably relate to overseas jurisdictions.

Circumstances commonly are that an overseas body will require verification of a
specific document (and verification of the individual signing the document) and
a certificate will be required from a Notary Public. Sometimes an additional
verification is required, and this is called legalisation. In such case, we will
make contact with the Foreign Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) on your
behalf and seek an official government certificate called an apostille.

In limited instances, certain overseas jurisdictions will require a third layer
of validation, which necessitates sealing by an embassy. We can advise and
assist on all of the above.

As a Notary Public practice, we have to comply with strict professional,
anti-money-laundering and data protection regulations, and we are required to
maintain professional indemnity insurance. We are also subject to is subject to
periodic review. We also have to maintain our knowledge and professionalism by
attendance at continuing professional education updates every year.
