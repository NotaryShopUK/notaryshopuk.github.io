## Privacy policy

**Our statement on data protection and privacy.**

### Data protection

This Policy (“Policy”) sets out the Data Protection Principles which we and our
Notary, Dermot Winters, (“Notary”) commit to comply with when processing
personal data in the course of our business as notary public (“Business”).

The Business has notified its data processing activities to the Information
Commissioner’s Office under registration number: ZB478046.

The Appendix contains a Glossary of the defined terms in this Policy.

#### Compliance with this Policy

The Business will ensure the protection of personal data in accordance with this
Policy by the Notary, all Personnel and Suppliers. 

A breach of data protection laws by the Notary, any Personnel or Supplier could
result not only in monetary penalties awarded against the Business but also
negative publicity which could affect the Business as well as the entire
notaries’ profession.

#### Data protection principles

The Business shall comply with the following Data Protection Principles when
processing personal data.

1. Fairness and Transparency: The Business must process personal data fairly and
	provide individuals with information about how and why their personal data is
	processed. 

	The Business must provide a privacy notice to each client, Personnel and
	Supplier to inform them of:
	* the identity of the Business as Controller;
	* the purposes for which their personal data are processed;
	* the legal basis for processing;
	* any legitimate interests pursued by the Business or a third party, if
		applicable;
	* the recipients or categories of recipients of the personal data, if any;
	* where applicable, the fact that the Business intends to transfer personal
		data to a third country or international organisation and the existence or
		absence of an adequacy decision by the relevant authority, or reference to
		the appropriate or suitable safeguards and the means by which to obtain a
		copy of them or where they have been made available;
	* the period for which the personal data will be stored, or if that is not
		possible, the criteria used to determine that period; 
	* the existence of the right to request from the Controller access to and
		rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing
		concerning the data subject or to object to processing as well as the right
		to data portability;
	* the existence of the right to withdraw consent at any time, if applicable;
	* the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority;
	* whether the provision of personal data is a statutory or contractual
		requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract, as well as
		whether the data subject is obliged to provide the personal data and of the
		possible consequences of failure to provide such data; and
	* the existence of Automated Decisions, including profiling, and, at least in
		those cases, meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the
		significance and the envisaged consequences of such processing for the data
		subject.

	For example, such privacy notice should be included in each client engagement
	letter or service agreement. If no engagement letter is issued, the privacy
	notice can be made available on the Business website or in other appropriate
	and easily accessible form. If the notice is published on the website, a
	conspicuous link to the website or privacy notice should be included in the
	Business email footer or other Notary stationery to bring the notice to the
	data subjects’ attention.

	Where a client provides personal data of third-party data subjects to the
	Business, no notice will have to be provided to those third party data
	subjects by the Business if such information must remain confidential subject
	to an obligation of professional secrecy. To the extent that no such
	obligation of professional secrecy applies, the Business should place a
	contractual obligation on each client and Supplier to ensure that such notice
	is provided to those third party data subjects on behalf of the Business. 

2. Lawful Processing: The Business must only process personal data, including
	special category personal data, lawfully where it has a valid basis for the
	processing.  

	Generally, personal data must not be processed without a legal ground. In the
	context of the Business, personal data are typically processed on the basis
	that:
	* processing is necessary for the performance of a contract (e.g. engagement
		letter) to which the data subject (e.g. the client) is party or in order to
		take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a
		contract;
	* processing is necessary for the legitimate interests pursued by a client or
		the Business, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or
		fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject. This ground may apply
		to the processing of the personal data of any third-party data subjects
		whose personal data are provided by the client;
	* a legal obligation to which the Business is subject and where compliance
		with such obligation necessitates the processing of personal data by the
		Business;
	* the data subject consents, where such consent is procured from the client;
		and
	* other legal grounds such as protecting the vital interests of the data
		subject or processing of personal data in the public interest.

3. Purpose Limitation: The Business must only collect personal data for a
	specific, explicit and legitimate purpose. Any subsequent processing should be
	compatible with that purpose, unless the Business has obtained the
	individual’s consent or the processing is otherwise permitted by law.

	The Business will typically process:

	* the personal data of its clients as required for the purposes of providing
		its professional services and the administration of its client relationship; 
	* the personal data of its Personnel as required for the administration of
		Personnel, if applicable; 
	* the personal data of its Suppliers as required for the administration of its
		Supplier relationships, if applicable; and
	* the personal data of its clients, Personnel and Suppliers as is necessary in
		order to comply with its legal obligations.

	The Business will generally not carry out any unsolicited electronic marketing,
	but to the extent it does, it will have to comply with the law. 

4. Data Minimisation: The Business must only process personal data that is
	adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for the purpose for which
	it was collected. 

	The Business should place a contractual obligation on each client to ensure
	that only the minimum necessary personal data is provided in connection with
	the professional services sought.

	Where a client provides personal data that appears excessive in connection
	with the professional services sought, the Business will return such personal
	data to the client and request that only necessary personal data is provided.
 
5. Data Accuracy: The Business must take reasonable steps to ensure personal
	data is accurate, complete, and kept up-to-date.

	The Business should place a contractual obligation on each client to ensure
	that any personal data provided in connection with the professional services
	sought is accurate, complete and up to date.

	The Business will endeavour to keep an accurate record of personal data in
	relation to its clients and Personnel.

6. Individual Rights: The Business must allow individuals to exercise their
	rights in relation to their personal data, including their rights of access,
	erasure, rectification, portability and objection.

	The Business will ensure that all Individual Rights Requests are correctly
	identified and appropriately responded to, subject to any applicable
	exemptions.

7. Storage Limitation: The Business must only keep personal data for as long as
	it is needed for the purpose for which it was collected or for a further
	permitted purpose.

	The Business will keep all records as long as required by applicable law or as
	may be necessary having regard to custom, practice or the nature of the
	documents concerned. For example, the Notaries Practice Rules 2014 require
	that that notarial acts in the public form shall be preserved permanently.
	Records of acts not in public form shall be preserved for a minimum period of
	12 years. 

	Save for personal data included in records which must kept for a prescribed
	period or preserved permanently in compliance with any legal obligations to
	which the Business is subject, such as the obligation explained above,
	personal data shall be kept for no longer than necessary for the relevant
	purpose. For example, any Personnel records should be kept for no longer than
	12 months following the termination of employment or contract, unless a longer
	retention is required under applicable law.  

8. Data Security: The Business must use appropriate security measures to protect
	personal data, including where third parties are processing personal data on
	our behalf.

	The Business will adopt the following security measures:
	* Physical security measures
		* ensure physical security of premises, e.g. locked office;
		* keep documents in locked cabinets;
		* reduce access privileges to only those needed;
		* grant access to only such Personnel who need to have access in connection
			with their duties;
		* dispose of documents using a confidential bin or through a cross cut
			shredder; and
		* other appropriate physical security measures.

	* Organisational security measures
		* vet Personnel and Suppliers on a continuing basis;
		* implement non-disclosure agreements prior to entering into formalised
			agreements;
		* provide training to Personnel where appropriate; 
		* implement a strict ban on the use of personal email for work purposes; and
		* other appropriate organisational security measures.

	* Technical security measures
		* firewalls which are properly configured and using the latest software;
		* regular patch management and OS updates;
		* real-time protection anti-virus, anti-malware and anti-spyware software;
		* user access control management by, for example, the UAC functionality in
			Windows, adopting principle of least privileges; 
		* unique passwords of sufficient complexity and regular (but not too
			frequent) expiry;
		* encryption of all portable devices ensuring appropriate protection of the
			key; 
		* data backup; and
		* other appropriate technical security measures.

	The Business will comply with Policy: Appointing Suppliers.

9. Accountability: We must take steps to comply with, and be able to demonstrate
	compliance, with the Data Protection Principles. 

	The Business will implement appropriate governance processes as set out in
	this Policy.

#### Governance processes

In order to ensure that the Data Protection Principles are implemented the
Business shall adopt the following governance processes.  

##### A. Documented Policies

In order to ensure compliance with Data Protection Principle 9 (Accountability),
the Business shall comply with this Policy and implement such other data
protection policies and establish internal governance processes from time to
time as may be required in order to operate the Business in compliance with data
protection laws. 

##### B. Assurance

The Business will ensure, by way of training or otherwise, that Personnel carry
out their tasks in a way that will ensure compliance with data protection laws.
Each member of Personnel and each Supplier shall have access to this Policy and
it shall have an obligation to comply with it.

Each Supplier will have to comply with data protection obligations in accordance
with its service agreement including, where appropriate, a data processing
agreement.

The Business shall periodically review this Policy and other policies to ensure
that they continue to comply with the relevant legal requirements. 

##### C. Advice 

Where necessary the Business shall seek advice in order to ensure that its
processes comply with data protection laws. 

##### D. Third Parties 

The Business shall comply with Policy: Appointing Suppliers in relation to
appointing any third-party contractor or supplier who will process personal data
on behalf of the Business. 

##### E. Data Protection Impact Assessments

The Business shall implement a process so that any processing which is likely to
result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals is subject to a
documented Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA), to assess the risks
associated with the proposed processing and identify any safeguards which should
be put in place to mitigate those risks. The Business shall maintain a record of
each DPIA.

##### F. Record-keeping

The Business will implement a process to maintain an up-to-date documented
record of its processing activities by way of adding relevant information in the
Notary register or by other appropriate means. This record should include a
general description of the following:
* The purpose of the processing: typically, in relation to Business transactions
	this will include processing to deliver client services;
* The categories of personal data and individuals to whom the data relates: a
	variety of mostly legal documents with copies of identity information relating
	to clients;
* The categories of recipients (if any), including both Controllers and
	Processors, and any transfers outside the UK to countries which may not have
	adequate data protection laws with an indication of how such transfer is
	contractually controlled: either the client or a third party to whom the
	client wished the documents to be sent after processing and such parties may
	often be located outside the UK;
* Where possible, the envisaged retention period for the personal data: records
	will be retained in accordance with the Notaries Practice Rules; and
* Where possible, a general description of the technical and organisational
	security measures in place: the measures in place as set out at paragraph 8
	above.

Although it is envisaged that the Business will act as Controller in most cases,
where the Business processes personal data on behalf of another person the
Business will make sure to maintain a record of its activities as a Processor
and/or Controller. This record should include a general description of the
following:
* The identity of the Business and contact details.
* The categories of processing carried out on behalf of the third party.
* Any transfers outside the UK.
* Where possible, a general description of the technical and organisational
	security measures in place.

##### G. Privacy By Design

When implementing a new processing activity, tool or functionality involved in
the processing of personal data, the Business will ensure, by contractual means
or otherwise, that such activity, tool or functionality is designed and built in
a way that allows us to comply with the Data Protection Principles.

##### H. Complaint handling

The Business shall implement a process to receive and handle enquiries and
complaints from individuals and the supervisory authorities concerning the
processing of personal data. 

The Business shall ensure that all enquiries and complaints are dealt with in a
timely manner, in compliance with any applicable statutory deadlines.

#### Data policies

##### International data transfers

17. We may disclose or transfer your personal data to a third party in countries
	outside the United Kingdom for further processing in accordance with the
	purposes for which your personal data were originally collected or for
	purposes to which you have consented. In these circumstances we will ensure
	that your rights are adequately protected by technical and contractual means,
	in particular that appropriate transfer mechanisms, such as the UK
	International Data Transfer Agreement, are in place to ensure an adequate
	level of data protection, where applicable.

##### Retention of personal data

18. Your personal data will be retained for as long as is reasonably necessary
	for the purposes listed above or as required by the law. For example, the
	Notaries Practice Rules require that that notarial acts in the public form
	shall be preserved permanently. Records of acts not in public form shall be
	preserved for a minimum period of 12 years. Please contact us for further
	details of applicable retention periods. Personal data may for reasons of
	security and convenience be stored on remote data facilities but in an
	encrypted form.

19. We may keep an anonymized form of your personal data, which will no longer
	refer to you, for statistical purposes without time limits, to the extent that
	we have a legitimate and lawful interest in doing so.

##### Security of personal data

20. The Business will implement technical and organisational security measures
	in order to prevent unauthorised access to your personal data. 

21. However, please be aware that the transmission of information via the
	internet is never completely secure. Whilst we can do our best to keep our own
	systems secure, we do not have full control over all processes involved in,
	for example, your use of our website or sending confidential materials to us
	via email, and we cannot therefore guarantee the security of your information
	transmitted to us on the web.

##### Data subject rights

22. Data subjects have numerous rights in relation to their personal data. For
	further information about your data protection rights please visit the
	[ICO website](https://ico.org.uk).

	* Right to make a subject access request (SAR). Data subjects may request in
		writing copies of their personal data. However, compliance with such
		requests is subject to certain limitations and exemptions and the rights of
		other data subjects. Each request should make clear that a SAR is being
		made. You may also be required to submit a proof of your identity and
		payment, where applicable.
	* Right to rectification. Data subjects may request that we rectify any
		inaccurate or incomplete personal data.
	* Right to withdraw consent. Data subjects may at any time withdraw their
		consent to the processing of their personal data carried out by the Business
		on the basis of previous consent. Such withdrawal will not affect the
		lawfulness of processing based on previous consent.
	* Right to object to processing, including automated processing and profiling.
		The Business does not make automated decisions. Profiling may be carried out
		for Business administration purposes, such as monitoring trends in user
		visits of our website, and in order to deliver targeted ads. The Business
		may use third party due diligence platforms which provide recommendations
		about data subjects by automated means. We will comply with any data
		subject’s objection to processing unless we have a compelling overriding
		legitimate ground for the processing, the processing is for the
		establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims or we have another lawful
		reason to refuse such request. We will comply with each valid opt-out
		request in relation to marketing communications.
	* Right to erasure. Data subjects may request that we erase their personal
		data. We will comply, unless there is a lawful reason for not doing so. For
		example, there may be an overriding legitimate ground for keeping the
		personal data, such as, our archiving obligations that we have to comply
		with.
	* Data subjects may request that we restrict our processing of their personal
		data in various circumstances. We will comply, unless there is a lawful
		reason for not doing so, such as, a legal obligation to continue processing
		your personal data in a certain way.
	* Right to data portability. In certain circumstances, data subjects may
		request the controller to provide a copy of their personal data in a
		structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and have it
