## Terms of business

**Our agreement for business.**

We offer appointments during business hours and occasionally outside of business
hours in exceptional circumstances. We are also prepared to make home visits or
visit corporate clients at their place of business. If the notarial appointments
take place outside of our office we will make an additional charge to cover
travelling time and expenses.  Occasionally we may not be able to see you within
the timeframe you require, or we may decide that we are am not able to act for
you in which case we will advise you that that is the case and will provide you
with the necessary information to locate an alternative notary.

It will save time, expense and mistakes if, as long before the appointment as
possible, you can let us have the originals or photocopies of the documents to
be notarised, relevant communications and most importantly – your identification
documents.

We will need you to produce by way of formal identification the original of (in
preferred order):
* Your current passport, and/or
* A current pictorial driving licence or national identity card.

If neither of the above are available, at least two of the following
* A current government or police issue certificate bearing a photo or other
	formal means of identification;
* A utility bill, credit card or bank statement showing your current address
	which should not be more than 3 months old or council tax bill;

You must also bring any other means of ID which may be referred to in the papers
sent to you as being required such as a foreign Identity Card.  We may also ask
to see further evidence of identity such as marriage certificates etc and will
advise you of this if necessary.

**Proof of names**: In a case where the name on the document is different from
the name you are currently using, or there has been a variation in the form of
spelling of the name over the years, please provide us as appropriate with
a Certificate of Birth, Marriage or Divorce Decree, or Change of Name Deed showing
all the different names that you use.  If there has been a change of name, then
we will need to see a copy of the Deed Poll or Statutory Declaration which dealt
with it.

**Advice on the document**: If you bring a document to us for authorisation as a
Notary, we will advise you as to the formalities required for completing it.
However, we will not be attempting to advise you about the transaction itself.

**Written Translations**: It is essential that **you understand what you are
signing**.
* If the document is in a foreign language which you do not understand
	sufficiently, we may have to insist that a translation be obtained. If we
	arrange for a translation, a further fee will be payable and we will provide
	you with details of this.
* If you arrange for a professional translation, the translator should add
	his/her name, address, relevant qualification, and a certificate stating:
	“Document X is a true and complete translation of document Y, to which this
	translation is attached.”

**Oral Interpreter**: If you and we cannot understand each other because of a
language difficulty, we may have to make arrangements for a competent
interpreter to be available at our interview and this may involve a further fee.

**Companies, Partnerships, etc.**: If a document is to be signed by you on
behalf of a company, a partnership, a charity, club or other incorporated body,
there are further requirements on which we may have to insist. Please be
prepared for these and telephone with any point of difficulty before attending
on the appointment.

**In each case**:
1. Evidence of identity of the authorised signatory (as listed above).
2. A copy of the current letterhead (showing the registered office if it is a
	company).
3. A Letter of Authority, Minute, Resolution or Power of Attorney, authorising
	you to sign the document.

*Additionally, companies*: Certificate of Incorporation and of any Change of
Name, a copy of the Memorandum and Articles of Association, Details of Directors
and Secretaries.  In all instances we will be carrying out various company
searches, which may have an effect on the level of fees charged.

*Additionally, partnerships, clubs, etc.*: A Partnership Agreement; or relevant
Trust Deed; or Charter; or Constitution/Rules.

**Notarial charges and expenses**: Details of our charges are set out below.
Please note that if we have to make payments on your behalf such as legalisation
fees, translator or interpreter fees, or other costs such as travelling
expenses, your approval to these will be obtained and you are normally required
to make payment in advance of any such amounts.

*Charges*: If the matter is straightforward we will endeavour to charge a fixed
fee to include disbursements such as legalisation fees, postage, consular agent
fees, courier fees, travelling expenses, translating costs and so on.  Our
practice does not currently charge VAT. For more complicated or time-consuming
matters the fee will be based on our hourly rate of £175 subject to a minimum
fee of £100 plus disbursements. The fee charged may include time spent on
preliminary advice, drafting and preparation time, making and receiving
telephone calls, correspondence written and received in all formats, arranging
legalisation and record keeping.

*Disbursements*: Some documents require legalisation before they will be
accepted for use in the receiving jurisdiction by obtaining an apostille through
the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office and, for some countries, additional
legalisation is required through the relevant embassy or consulate. 

Payment can be made by bank transfer. Payment of our fee and disbursements is
due when the document has been prepared which we may retain pending payment in
full.

Occasionally unforeseen or unusual issues arise during the course of the matter
which may result in a revision of our fee estimate. Examples of this could
include where additional documents are required to be notarised, additional
translations or legalisations are needed to meet the requirements of the
receiving jurisdiction, third party fees are adjusted to reflect external
factors such as fuel price changes and so on.  We will notify you of any changes
in the fee estimate as soon as possible.

**Typical Stages of a notarial transaction**: Each notarial matter is different
and the requirements and timescales will vary greatly according to whether the
client is a private individual or a company and in particular according to the
processing times of third parties such as the Foreign and Commonwealth Office,
legalisation agents, translating agencies and couriers, etc. Some of the typical
key stages are likely to include:
* Receiving and reviewing the documents to be notarised together with any
	instructions you may have received
* Liaising with your legal advisors or other bodies to obtain the necessary
	documentation to deal with the document (e.g. information from Companies House
	or foreign registries, powers of attorney, etc.)
* Checking the identity, capacity and authority of the person who is to sign the
	document
* If a document is to be certified, checking with the issuing authorities that
	the document/award is genuine &mdash; in the case of academic awards, this
	would entail checking with the appropriate academic institutions
* Meeting with the signatory to verify their identity and to ascertain that they
	understand what they are signing and that they are doing so of their own free
	will and ensuring that the document is executed correctly
* Drafting and affixing or endorsing a notarial certificate to the document
* Arranging for the legalisation of the document as appropriate
* Arranging for the storage of copies of all notarised documents in accordance
	with the requirements of the Notarial Practice Rules 2019

**Notarial Records and Data Protection**: When we carry out our work for you, we
are required to make an entry in a formal register, which is kept by us as a
permanent record.  We will retain a copy of the notarised documentation with
that record.  Our practice is a registered with the Information Commissioner’s
Office. Personal data received from clients is held securely and not capable of
being accessed externally. Data collected as part of notarial records is used
solely for the purposes of meeting our professional legal responsibilities as
Notaries Public. For full details of our Privacy Policy and data processing
terms, please see our [privacy policy](/privacy).

**Insurance**: In the interests of our clients we maintain professional
indemnity insurance at a level of at least £1,000,000.00 per claim.

**Termination/Your Right to Cancel**: You may terminate your instructions to us
at any time by giving us reasonable written notice. All fees and disbursements
incurred up to the date of termination will be charged.

*Consumer Cooling Off Cancellation Period &mdash; Consumer Contracts Regulations
2013 (“CCR”)*: Where the CCR apply (typically where you are an individual
consumer and our contract with you was concluded either at or following a
meeting with you or by a form of distance communication) you have a cancellation
period of 14 days after the date you sign our retainer letter or the date on
which you continue to give us instructions, whichever is earlier. You can cancel
your contract within the cancellation period by giving us a clear statement and
we will reimburse all payments received from you by the same method that you
used, at no cost to you, without undue delay, and not later than 14 days after
the day on which you inform us of the cancellation.

If you ask us to begin work during the cancellation period, you can still cancel
but you must pay us an amount in proportion to the work which we have performed
and this proportion will not be reimbursed to you.

**Termination by us**: We reserve the right to terminate our engagement by you
if we have good reason to do so, for example, if you do not pay a bill or comply
with our request for a payment on account or you fail to give us the
co-operation which we are reasonably entitled to expect.
